 *                   
 *                   This function must set the desired pin as OUTPUT and set to LOW.
 *                   It is used by the driver to send ZEROs or ACKs.
 * 
 * cb_sda_high_z:    Callback to set HIGH-Z/INPUT in the SDA line.
 *                   
 *                   This function must set the desired pin as INPUT. 
 *                   It acts as an open colector in HIGH state.
 *                   It is used by the driver to send ONEs, or NACKs or listen the line.
 * 
 * cb_scl_drive_low: Callback to drive LOW in the SCL line.
 * 
 *                   Works like cb_sda_drive_low()
 * 
 * cb_sda_high_z:    Callback to set HIGH-Z/INPUT in the SCL line.
 * 
 *                   Works like cb_sda_high_z()
